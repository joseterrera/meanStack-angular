comments on this tutorial from thinkster...


comments: data that persists accross multiple controllers and pages are called services, especifically factories that operate as a singleton: it will be available everywhere at every time.
Our first factory will hold our array of posts.
Then we will inject it to our main controller.

Thus, most of the business and persistent data should be stored in services. For memory purposes, controllers are instantiated when needed and discarded when they are not.
